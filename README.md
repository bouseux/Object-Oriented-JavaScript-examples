Object-Oriented-JavaScript-examples
===================================

Tutorial which I took to sharpen up my Javascript skills.
Tutorial from TutsPlus at https://code.tutsplus.com/courses/object-oriented-javascript/lessons/introduction .

Some things that I learnt:
 - You can only self-invoke functions that were built using function expression. For example,
 `var foo = function() {}();`
